title: Shortcuts. Day One.
---

I've been using [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) to log everyday activities at work. One of the best
things is that it supports [markdown syntax](https://dayone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200265094-Markdown-Guide).

To standartize format of work entries I've started using mac os keyboard
shortcuts:
- `workdaily` expands to

```
# Daily 2015-XX-XX

## Email

## Sprint

## Misc

#workdaily
```
Looks like this:

- `tshoot` is used for troubleshooting

```
