Couple of weeks age I've read [Sergey Bronnikov's article](http://blog.bronevichok.ru/2015/10/23/twisource.html)
about tools they use. In the end Sergey was asking about any feedback.

I've walked thought the [source code](https://github.com/ligurio/twisource) of the tool.
My `python` backgroud was confused a bit, because the code-style was at least terrible.
So I've decided to form my feedback as a [pull-request](https://github.com/ligurio/twisource/pull/1).
And here we go, my pull request was accepted.
