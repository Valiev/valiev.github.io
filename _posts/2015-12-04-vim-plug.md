Vim is really great editor. But to extend it to fit my into personal needs I
use plugin manager. I used to use [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim),
but migrated to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) recently.
And I really enjoy it.

[Installation](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation) is easy.
To enable plugin-manager it requires to add `call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')` to your `.vimrc` file.
